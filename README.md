# Ground-truth-of-nine-video-dataset

This is the ground truth of nine-video dataset in the paper 'DTIRï¼šHead-integrated tracking method for construction workers dealing with occlusion challenges'.
We labeled the ground truth bounding boxes manually with MOT16_Annotator from https://github.com/khalidw/MOT16_Annotator. 
This tool takes video as an input and allows the user to create bounding boxes on each frame, these bounding boxes are saved to a gt.txt file in MOT16 format.
